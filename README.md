                  initialize population;
                  evaluate population;
                  while TerminationCriteriaNotSatisfied
                {
                  select parents for reproduction;
                  perform recombination and mutation;
                  evaluate population;
                }

Initialize population:
The initial population is a set of random routes generated using numpy.

Evaluate population:
The evaluation is a process of finding how good the solutions is.
