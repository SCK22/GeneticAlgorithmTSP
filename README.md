Initialize population:
The initial population is a set of random routes generated using numpy.

Evaluate population:
The evaluation is a process of finding how good the solutions is. This is <img src = "img/initial_population_cost.PNG">

Mutation:

Crossover:

### OverallRun:
          ga_obj = GeneticAlgoLibrary.OverallGaRun(noverall=1,
                                         number_of_cities=11,

                                         percentage_to_crossover=20,
                                         percentage_to_mutate=20,
                                         dist_mat=data1)
### If you want to run the genetic algorithm with multiple runs
      for i in [10,100,1000]:
          ga_obj = GeneticAlgoLibrary.OverallGaRun(noverall=i,
                                               number_of_cities=11,
                                               initial_pop_size=1000,
                                               nelite=10,
                                               percentage_to_crossover=20,
                                               percentage_to_mutate=20,
                                               dist_mat=data1)
          ga_obj.runOverallGa()

Final:

_Note:_

_1. The final solution was obtained after multiple runs of the Genetic Algorithm with different inital population sizes and overall runs._

_2. The map needs access to city_lat_lon data, in the code to the file that is availabe in the data folder, if you are running the code from a different folder, the path should be changed accordingly._
